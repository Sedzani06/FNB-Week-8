# 🛒 FNB App Academy – Week 8: Python Collections & Mini Project

This week we continued our Python journey by diving deeper into **data structures** and applying them in a practical project!

## ✅ Topics Covered
- **Lists** – storing and accessing multiple items
- **Tuples** – working with immutable collections
- **Sets** – handling unique elements
- **Dictionaries** – using key-value pairs to store related data

## 🛍️ Mini Project: Python Shopping Cart
We built a simple shopping cart program that:
- Continuously asks the user to enter a food item and its price
- Lets the user stop adding items with an exit option
- Displays the full list of items in the cart
- Calculates and shows the **total cost** at the end

## 💡 Highlights
- Practiced using loops with collection types
- Gained confidence in collecting and processing user input

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Python
- Command-line interface (CLI)

This week was all about applying what I’ve learned to solve a real problem using logic, loops, and collections.
